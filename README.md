# RICHORD
RICHORD is a React based website, allowing users to create melodies and develop a foundational understanding of basic notes and keys. Create your own tracks and play them back!

As our first team-oriented project at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive (SEI) course, our task was to build a full stack web product, implementing our own backend and database via Sequelize, Express, React and Router.
